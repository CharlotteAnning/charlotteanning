## Hi there 👋

I am currently working on expanding my coding portfolio to advance my career in data analytics, so I thought I would showcase some of my work! 

- Python shows some of my recent fun projects with Python 🐍
- Creativity is the repository that exhibits some of the ways I got creative in both my BSc and MSc 👩‍🎨
- SQL is a work in progress as I am advancing my SQL practice
- LIFE4136_rotation3 is one of my MSc rotations which used Python, C, Shell and R to explore ploidy patterns in Arabidopsis 🌸
- Coming soon: my work with Excel!! 📊

<!--
**LottieAnning/lottieanning** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- UNIX
- SQL
- Power BI
- Excel
- R
