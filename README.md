## Hi there 👋

I am currently searching for a data analytics job so I thought I would showcase some of my work! 

- Python shows some of my recent fun projects with Python 🐍
- Creativity is the repository that exhibits some of the ways I got creative in both my BSc and MSc 👩‍🎨
- LIFE4136_rotation3 is one of my MSc rotations which used Python, C, Shell and R to explore ploidy patterns in Arabidopsis 🌸
- Coming soon: my work with Excel!! 📊
